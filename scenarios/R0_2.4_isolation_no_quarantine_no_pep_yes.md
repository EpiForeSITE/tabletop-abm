## Data preparation

Setting up an empty model for the moment, we will be using the data from
the davis county:

Looking into the data

We can take a look at the mixing matrix

![](R0_2.4_isolation_no_quarantine_no_pep_yes_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

The image shows a big diagonal in the middle which is expected as
school-age individuals will contact mostly with their peers (most of the
groups we have are schools).

## Model creating

Se will be assuming two values

- Incubation period is 2 to 5 days.
- Basic reproductive number will be between 1.5 and 3.

To compute the basic reproductive number, we use the following:

We now start adding some of the entities from the population data:

Ensuring that the virus starts at a school similar to that of the case

Checking if the model includes post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)

We want to check that the index case is effectively one within the
school (entity 13):


    TRUE 
     400 

We can also look at the distribution of the reproductive number for the
index case

| 0   |      0.3925 |
| 1   |      0.2375 |

Reproductive number distribution for the index case (Average R0: 1.78 )

The function call will get us the results as a list of data.frames
(data.table objects in this case). We will use the `data.table` package
to manipulate the information.

## Outbreak size

Finally, since we are only interested about the final outbreak size (in
this case), can will collapse the data to get the total number of cases
at the final simulation day. Subsequently, we can plot the results using
the `hist` function:

    Warning in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log): 4168 y values <= 0 omitted
    from logarithmic plot

We can also investigate the distribution of the final counts

<!-- ## Hospitalizations
&#10;In the case of the hospitalizations, we can draw a similar figure. The hospitalizations data contains the following information:
&#10;1. Cases per virus (just measles in this case).
2. Cases per tool (or the lack of). Information about "no tool" is recorded with a `tool_id == -1`.
3. The counts (how many records in the data).
4. Weights.
&#10;The weights attribute is to ensure that we take into consideration counting individuals more than once. For instance, if a model has more than one tool (not just vaccination), the individual who has two tools would be included twice in `count`. Thus, if we wanted to count the raw number of hospitalization cases, we would add across `weight`, but the `count` variable yields how many individuals were hospitalized under that combination of tool and virus id.
&#10;
&#10;::: {.cell}

We can create a couple of boxplot to show how many cases we see per vaccination status:
