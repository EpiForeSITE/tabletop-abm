title: "Tabletop ABM for Davis County, Utah"
---

This repository presents a tabletop agent-based model (ABM) for disease spread in Davis County, Utah. The model utilizes age mixing data to simulate disease transmission dynamics under various intervention scenarios, including isolation, quarantine, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

This is not a real situation and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Links to the scenarios

The following table links to the reports generated for each of the scenarios run for Davis County:

```{r}
#| label: listing
#| echo: false
fns <- list.files(path = "scenarios", pattern = "\\.md$", full.names = TRUE)

# Processing the names
scenarios <- data.frame(
  R0 = gsub(".+R0_([0-9.]+)_.*", "\\1", fns),
  Isolation = gsub(".+isolation_([A-Za-z]+)_.*", "\\1", fns),
  Quarantine = gsub(".+quarantine_([A-Za-z]+)(\\.|_).+", "\\1", fns),
  PEP = ifelse(grepl("_pep_yes", fns), "yes", "no"),
  Link = paste0("[View Report](", fns, ")")
)

# Sorting by R0, Isolation, Quarantine
scenarios <- scenarios[
  order(
    as.numeric(scenarios$R0),
    scenarios$Isolation,
    scenarios$Quarantine,
    scenarios$PEP
  ),
]

knitr::kable(
  scenarios,
  caption = "Links to the scenario reports for Davis County",
  row.names = FALSE
